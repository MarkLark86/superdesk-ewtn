			<description><![CDATA[<p><em>Archbishop Christophe Pierre was appointed apostolic nuncio to the United States in April 2016, after the archbishop had served as nuncio in Mexico, Uganda, and Haiti. As apostolic nuncio, Pierre is the Holy See&rsquo;s diplomat to the United States, and the representative of Pope Francis to the U.S. bishops, and to all Catholics in the country.</em></p>

<p><em>Pierre, who celebrated 50 years of priesthood this month, spoke with CNA about living the Catholic faith during the coronavirus pandemic.</em></p>

<p><br />
<strong>Your Excellency, throughout this pandemic Pope Francis has given us beautiful signs of our need for prayer: <a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-francis-makes-walking-prayer-pilgrimage-for-coronavirus-pandemic-40105">His walking pilgrimage</a>, <a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/the-cross-is-our-hope-pope-gives-urbi-et-orbi-blessing-during-coronavirus-25412">the Urbi et Orbi blessing</a>, and his <a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/be-messengers-of-life-amid-death-says-pope-francis-at-easter-vigil-83265">celebration of the Paschal Triduum in the near-empty St. Peter&#39;s Basilica</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>What message is the Holy Father giving during this pandemic? What does he want Catholics to remember and to understand?</strong></p>

<p>During these days, we have received a lot of messages on our smartphones. A friend of mine sent me a humorous picture of God talking to the &lsquo;enemy.&rsquo; The evil one saying, &ldquo;With COVID19 I have closed your churches,&rdquo; and with God answering, &ldquo;On the contrary, I have opened a church in each house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have been so impressed by the beautiful simplicity and the depth of the Holy Father&rsquo;s Urbi et Orbi blessing in St. Peter&rsquo;s Square. His meditation reached out to us to where we are. Consistent with what he has tried to tell us in the last six years, he helped us to understand. This is what a leader should do. As we suddenly rediscover our vulnerability, he invited us to rely on God and one another.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>During this pandemic, we know that people are suffering around the world, from the virus and from the economic collapse. Yet while we want to help, we are bound in our homes. What works of mercy can we do from our homes; what good can Catholics do to help during the pandemic?</strong></p>

<p>We are all confined to our homes. And it is quite painful. And the Shepherd wants to reach out to us in our homes, where we are mysteriously obliged to stay to protect ourselves, but also to prepare a new world, hopefully different. The suffering is immense, but we cannot remain alone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We want to go out, to re-build, and rediscover Christian core values, often forgotten; such as human dignity, centrality of the human person, solidarity, and fraternity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, we are not able to go to church, but our houses have become &lsquo;church&rsquo; &ndash; the domestic church, the place where we listen to the voice of God, and his life is received to transform us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From the empty churches the Good News has been announced and many people have suddenly experienced the power of the sacraments, living signs of God&rsquo;s presence in our lives...God who accompanies us, forgives us, and has united us to Him and to our mothers, fathers, brothers, and sisters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I celebrated the liturgies of Holy Week in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington. Even though the basilica was empty, I was told that a half million households connected to this public prayer of the Church through social media.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Archbishop, the economic collapse will have long-term repercussions in this country. More people are now unemployed than have been since the Great Depression. What role will the Church play as we adjust to a new economic reality, especially one that could be so gravely difficult?</strong></p>

<p>The economic collapse is disastrous; so many have lost almost everything. The economy which looked so strong showed its fragility in only a few weeks. And yet this country considers itself to be the strongest in the world. What about the poor?</p>

<p>There are no other solutions than to rebuild. Together. We are reminded by Pope Francis it is not the time to make arms. He even asked us to stop all kinds of useless wars. The new reality which will come out of this experience will necessarily be built upon a new way of using resources. The Church is made up of those who are disciples of the Prince of Peace and Justice, and who will participate actively in the construction of a new society.</p>

<p>During these days, I have witnessed the extraordinary work of Catholic institutions at all levels &ndash; parish, diocesan, and national &ndash; involved with helping and sharing. The particular contribution of the Church will always be attention to the poorest and weakest. To live out the story of the Good Samaritan.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>The pandemic has led many people to question the wisdom of an ever-globalizing economy. Pope Francis, in <em>Laudato si</em>, wrote about the importance of an economy at which the common good is at the center. What lessons does <em>Laudato si</em> have for the moment?</strong></p>

<p>In his meditation during the recent Orbi et Urbi, the Holy Father said: &ldquo;This storm exposes our vulnerability and uncovers false and superfluous certainties around which we have constructed our daily schedule, our projects, our habits, and our priorities...All those attempt to anesthetize us with ways of thinking and acting that supposedly &lsquo;save&rsquo; us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the last few years, many people did not appreciate the words of wisdom in <em>Laudato si</em> and many other reflections on the social doctrine of the Church. And yet, [those reflections] repeat basic principles, particularly the importance of an economy at the service of the common good, of economic systems serving the whole person and all people, the respect of God&rsquo;s creation, the sharing of what is given by God for our own good, solidarity and subsidiarity. These are fundamental ideas for the building of a just society and should inspire all of those who have a human responsibility; that is each one of us.</p>

<p>At the end of the meditation, the Holy Father said: &ldquo;embracing his own cross means finding the courage to embrace all the hardships at the present time, abandoning for a moment our eagerness for power and possessions in order to make room for the creativity that only the Spirit is capable of inspiring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Across the country, bishops have reacted in different ways to the stay-at-home orders, with regard to sacramental ministry. Some bishops have prohibited confession except in the most dire circumstances, or baptisms, or anointing. At the same time, many Catholics say they feel a great need for the sacraments to get through the crisis, and some priests have told me they would not be able to deny confession to a person in mortal sin. </strong></p>

<p><strong>What are the principles that should guide the Church right now with regard to sacramental ministry? What has been the approach of the Holy Father to these questions?</strong></p>

<p>I know the Shepherds of the Church have been suddenly obliged to make difficult decisions about the celebration of the liturgy and the sacraments, particularly during Holy Week. Most of the time, they have no other choice than to acknowledge &ndash; for good reasons &ndash; the decisions of those who have the responsibility for the common good. It was necessary and they have done well. Christians are faithful citizens and are called to live their faith in solidarity with all; to be the &ldquo;salt of the earth and light of the world.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For sure, the pope, bishops and priests have had to adjust to new situations. At times in normal circumstances, we may take for granted the sacraments of the Church. Perhaps, we are being led to rediscover the hunger for Christ&rsquo;s presence in the Eucharist, and his forgiveness in Confession.</p>

<p>I have observed that many [clerics] have sacrificed to be with their people and some have even given their lives. The Holy Father is continually encouraging us to be at the service of the people. Thank God for the creativity of the Church in the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is also another dimension to your question. It is true, in such extraordinary times we have to be creative, to discover new ways of doing things. However, we should never forget that the Church is the sacrament of the presence of God and his love for suffering humanity.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
<strong>What has your own prayer life been like during these times? How do you see the movement of the Holy Spirit in the Church right now?</strong></p>

<p>I am convinced that COVID19 has helped us to become aware of the fact that we are the Church. Each one of us, baptized in Christ, is an instrument of his presence, with a special role for our own salvation and the salvation of others.</p>

<p>My prayer? First and foremost, like many, I have felt powerless, vulnerable, like the disciples in the boat during the storm. Many of my &ldquo;certainties&rdquo; disappeared. My prayer has been to trust him, to have faith, and to ask him to be a more responsible and active participant of his body, the Church.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Joy is a grace and a gift of the Holy Spirit, not just positive emotions or feeling cheerful, Pope Francis said at Mass at the Vatican Thursday.</p>

<p>Joy &ldquo;is not the consequence of emotions that burst for a wonderful thing... No, it is more,&rdquo; he said April 16. &ldquo;This joy, this which fills us, is a fruit of the Holy Spirit. Without the Spirit one cannot have this joy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be full of joy,&rdquo; the pope said, &ldquo;is the experience of the highest consolation, when the Lord makes us understand that this is something different from being cheerful, positive, bright...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it is another thing,&rdquo; he continued. It is &ldquo;an overflowing joy that really hits us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Receiving the joy of the Spirit is a grace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pope reflected on joy as a fruit of the Holy Spirit during his morning Mass at his Vatican residence, the Casa Santa Marta.</p>

<p>He focused his homily on a line from St. Luke&rsquo;s Gospel, which recounts the appearance of Jesus to his disciples in Jerusalem after his resurrection.</p>

<p>The disciples were scared, believing they had seen a ghost, Francis explained, but Jesus showed them the wounds on his hands and feet, to assure them that it was him in the flesh.</p>

<p>A line then says: &ldquo;while [the disciples] were still incredulous for joy and were amazed...&rdquo;</p>

<p>This phrase &ldquo;gives me so much consolation,&rdquo; the pope said. &ldquo;This passage from the Gospel is one of my favorites.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He repeated: &ldquo;But since for joy they did not believe...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was so much joy that [the disciples thought], &lsquo;no, this cannot be true. This is not real, it is too much joy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said the disciples were so overflowing with joy, which is the fullness of consolation, the fullness of the presence of the Lord, it &ldquo;paralyzed&rdquo; them.</p>

<p>This is one of the desires St. Paul had for his people in Rome, when he wrote &ldquo;may the God of hope fill you with joy,&rdquo; Pope Francis explained.</p>

<p>He noted that the expression &ldquo;full of joy&rdquo; continues to be repeated throughout the Acts of the Apostles and on the day of Jesus&rsquo; ascension.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The disciples returned to Jerusalem, says the Bible, &lsquo;full of joy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pope Francis encouraged people to read the last few paragraphs of St. Pope Paul VI&rsquo;s exhortation, <em>Evangelii nuntiandi</em>.</p>

<p>Pope Paul VI &ldquo;speaks of joyful Christians, joyful evangelizers, and not those who live always &lsquo;down,&rsquo;&rdquo; Francis said.</p>

<p>He also pointed to a passage in the Book of Nehemiah which he said can help Catholics reflect on joy.</p>

<p>In Nehemiah chapter 8, the people returned to Jerusalem and rediscovered the book of the law. There was a &ldquo;great celebration and all the people gathered to listen to the priest Ezra, who read the book of the law,&rdquo; the pope described.</p>

<p>The people were moved and wept tears of joy, he said. &ldquo;When the priest Ezra finished, Nehemiah said to the people: &lsquo;Rest assured, now do not cry anymore, keep the joy, because joy in the Lord is your strength.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pope Francis said, &ldquo;this word from the book of Nehemiah will help us today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The great strength that we have to transform, to preach the Gospel, to go forward as witnesses of life is the joy of the Lord, which is a fruit of the Holy Spirit, and today we ask him to grant us this fruit,&rdquo; he concluded.</p>

<p>At the end of Mass, Pope Francis led an act of spiritual communion for all those who cannot receive the Eucharist and offered several minutes of silent adoration concluding with benediction.</p>

<p>Francis&rsquo; intention during the Mass, offered amid the coronavirus pandemic, was for pharmacists: &ldquo;they too work a lot to help the sick recover from sickness,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We also pray for them.&rdquo;</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A retirement residence run by the Little Sisters of the Poor in Delaware has seen almost a dozen deaths related to the novel coronavirus, although the sisters say other sick patients are recovering.</p>

<p>Sister Constance Veit, communications director for Little Sisters of the Poor, said 11 people have died from COVID-19 at Jeanne Jugan Residence in Newark, Delaware, since March 29.</p>

<p>According to The Dialog, the newspaper of the Diocese of Wilmington, there are more than 60 people living at the retirement residence, including 40 in the nursing unit.</p>

<p>However, Veit said it&rsquo;s been several days since the most recent death occurred, and other patients are beginning to recover.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have had 11 resident deaths related to Covid-19, but none for more than two days now, so we feel we may have turned a corner,&rdquo; she said on Sunday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was going around to wish the residents happy Easter and found a few of them who have been sick looking quite good,&rdquo; she said, according to The Dialog.</p>

<p>COVID-19 is particularly dangerous for elderly people and those with pre-existing medical conditions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that 80% of coronavirus deaths in the U.S. have occurred among people ages 65 years and older.</p>

<p>All of those who died from the virus at the Jeanne Jugan Residence suffered from an underlying condition, The Dialog reported.</p>

<p>Sister Veit reflected on the resurrection of Christ on Easter Sunday, and the hope it provides amid grief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today, on Easter Sunday, as I reflect on the loss of &hellip; residents, I realize that faith in the resurrection of Jesus is the only thing that can make sense out of this situation,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because of the resurrection we know that Jesus is still alive and walking at our side. Through our faith in the resurrection we believe that those who have died are in an unimaginably better place, no matter how good our earthly life has been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She added that while this did not diminish the loss experienced by those whose loved ones had died, she hopes they will find consolation in their belief in heaven.</p>

<p>Viet also expressed gratitude for those in the community who have donated various supplies to the residence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And for these we are so very grateful. I think we are OK for everything right now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We want to thank everyone in the local community for being so good to us and our residents.&rdquo;</p>]]></description>

			<link>https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/robustly-enforce-chemical-abortion-regulations-congressmen-tell-fda-20958</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/robustly-enforce-chemical-abortion-regulations-congressmen-tell-fda-20958</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>More than 150 members of Congress have written to the Food and Drug Administration in support of continued regulation of chemical abortions. The legislators wrote to the FDA Tuesday, in response to calls to expand access to at-home abortions during the pandemic.</p>

<p>The letter, sent April 14 to FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn, M.D., was signed by 121 members of the House and 38 senators. It calls on the FDA to keep the mifepristone-misoprostol chemical abortion regimen on the administration&rsquo;s Risk Evalutation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) list. The list is reserved for drugs of special concern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We write to urge you to continue to robustly enforce the REMS for medication abortion and end dangerous runarounds of these protections under the guise of medical research,&rdquo; the letter states. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) led the letter in the Senate, while Rep. Robert E. Latta (R-Ohio) led the letter in the House.</p>

<p>The FDA allows for chemical abortions, but requires that a certified prescriber dispense the two drug regimen of RU-486 and misoprostol after confirming the gestational age to be not more than 10 weeks and ruling out an ectopic pregnancy. The mother must also sign and keep a copy of the prescriber&rsquo;s agreement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The New York Times editorial board and others have called for making medication abortion more widely accessible with far less oversight&rdquo; through rolling back REMS safeguards during the coronavirus pandemic, the letter said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The lawmakers warned that complications from chemical abortions&mdash;which include cramping and bleeding&mdash;can be severe enough to require surgery in between five to seven percent of cases and said the relaxing of regulations on remote dispensing of the pills would lead to a lack of oversight.</p>

<p>The legislators called the proposal &ldquo;both reckless and dangerous&rdquo; and urged the FDA to &ldquo;stand confidently for the protection of women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The U.S. Catholic bishops&rsquo; conference supports the goals of the letter, according to Hyde-Smith&rsquo;s office. The USCCB website has <a href="http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/human-life-and-dignity/abortion/ru486.cfm">a fact sheet</a> on the risks and dangers of the chemical abortion regimen</p>

<p>The letter also calls on the FDA to investigate ongoing projects that involve remote dispensing of chemical abortion pills against REMS list provisions. This would include the Gynuity TelAbortion project, launched in 2015 and which is active in 13 states.</p>

<p>Some states have sought to halt chemical abortions along with all elective abortions, as non-essential medical procedures during the coronavirus pandemic. However, judges have allowed chemical abortions to continue despite executive orders in Texas, Oklahoma, Alabama, and Ohio.</p>]]></description>

			<link>https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/las-cruces-bishop-first-in-us-to-resume-public-masses-amid-pandemic-54349</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/las-cruces-bishop-first-in-us-to-resume-public-masses-amid-pandemic-54349</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Bishop of Las Cruces, New Mexico, has lifted a diocesan ban on the public celebration of Mass, issued guidelines for distribution of Holy Communion, and told priests they may resume sacramental ministry if they follow state-ordered health precautions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We [as priests] have been called by Christ and ordained to serve the people of the Diocese of Las Cruces, to bring them hope and consolation during this difficult time,&rdquo; Bishop Peter Baldacchino wrote in a letter dated April 15 and obtained by CNA.</p>

<p>The announcement came days after New Mexico&#39;s governor banned gatherings of more than 5 people, a restriction Baldacchino said priests must observe, even as the bishop expressed his objection to it.</p>

<p>Baldacchino&nbsp;is the first U.S. bishop known to have amended a previously declared diocesan ban on public Masses since the coronavirus pandemic took hold of the U.S. last month.</p>

<p>The bishop also made provision for priests to resume weddings and funerals in accordance with state regulations on social distancing, and granted permission for them to be held outside on Church property for the duration of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Christopher Velasquez, communications director of the diocese, confirmed the letter to CNA on Wednesday evening.</p>

<p>Velasquez&nbsp;stressed the &quot;essential ministry of hope&quot; the Church is called to undertake during the pandemic. He added that the diocese urges all Catholics in at-risk demographics to exercise prudence, remain at home and watch the Mass on livestream whenever possible</p>

<p>In his letter, Baldacchino said that &ldquo;At the outset of the pandemic, I ordered the priests of the Diocese of Las Cruces to suspend all public Masses as we assessed the situation and established a safe way to continue to bring Christ to the people, both through the Word of God and the Sacraments.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;These past few weeks have allowed me to further analyze the situation and discern a safe way to proceed,&rdquo; the bishop wrote.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has become increasingly clear that the state shutdown will last for some time. Depriving the faithful of the nourishment offered through the Eucharist was indeed a difficult decision, one that I deemed necessary until I had further clarity regarding our current state of affairs, but it cannot become the <em>status quo</em> for the foreseeable future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dioceses across the United States have suspended the public celebration of Mass, and many have restricted priests&rsquo; ability to hear confessions and anoint the sick. While priests in some dioceses have tried to find ways to provide sacramental ministry, including drive-in Masses and Eucharistic adoration, some bishops have banned these practices.</p>

<p>Baldacchino said in his letter that the public danger posed by the coronavirus had to inspire renewed reflection by the Church, and demanded a response from ministers. He also said that his action was in part inspired by the deaths of two priests, close friends and seminary classmates, who contracted the virus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are all aware of the tragedy caused by the Coronavirus, I myself have lost two close friends of mine, priests I studied and served with. I am fully conscious of the death and sadness these days seem to bring. And yet there is more. The Coronavirus can also be a help to us. How long have we settled down in our &lsquo;usual way&rsquo; of doing things? For how long have we grown comfortable with our routines? For how long have we taken the grace of the sacraments for granted? Or the beauty of the assembly at Mass?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Baldacchino said the crisis created by the pandemic had brought about &ldquo;a time for renewal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the events of these days and weeks the Lord is calling us out of our comfort zone, he is calling us to seek new ways to reach the people. In addition to this mission with which we are entrusted, we also have the mission to keep people safe. The two must be equally pursued,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While it is true that we need to take every reasonable precaution to reduce the spread of Coronavirus, it is equally true that we offer the greatest &lsquo;essential service&rsquo; to our people. The past few weeks have brought to light many unintended consequences of the &lsquo;stay-at-home&rsquo; order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bishop pointed to reports that the Disaster Distress Helpline, a federal crisis hotline run by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, has seen an 891% increase of calls during the pandemic, with large spikes also being recorded at suicide prevention hotlines. He also noted reports of increases in domestic violence in places under lockdown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simply put, in the midst of financial uncertainty, fear for one&rsquo;s health, pandemic induced anxiety and confinement to their homes, people definitely need a word of hope,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We, as priests, are called to bring the Word of Life to people, we are called to minister the life-giving sacraments. Televised Masses have been an attempt to bridge the gap during this time, but I am increasingly convinced that this is not enough,&rdquo; Baldacchino said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The eternal life offered in Christ Jesus needs to be announced. It was precisely the urgency of this announcement that drove the first apostles and the need is no less today. Christ is alive and we are his ambassadors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Revoking the suspension of public Masses, in place in the diocese since March 16, the bishop said that priests are now allowed to celebrate Masses in the presence of the faithful &ldquo;while maintaining all current health precautions set forth by the state and federal government.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Baldacchino&rsquo;s letter noted that the state of New Mexico recently updated its Public Health Order, which no longer includes churches as &ldquo;essential services.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I strongly disagree,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sadly, the Governor is no longer exempting places of worship from the restrictions on &lsquo;mass gatherings.&rsquo; It seems to me that while we run a daily count of the physical deaths we are overlooking those who are dead interiorly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To comply with the governor&rsquo;s directive, guidelines issued to all priests limit attendance at Mass in church buildings to 5 people, including the celebrant, and insist that a minimum safe distance of six feet be observed and all seating sanitized after Mass ends.</p>

<p>Baldacchino also authorized priests to celebrate Mass outdoors, in compliance with state guidance on social distancing, and specifically recommended setting up an altar in the parish parking lot with parishioners remaining in their cars with an empty space between each vehicle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Parishes that lack sufficient parking spaces may celebrate the liturgies in open cemeteries or other available open spaces. Parishioners should maintain at least a six feet separation at all times,&rdquo; the guidance states.</p>

<p>Over the Easter Triduum, the bishop had a stage erected outside the Cathedral of the Immaculate Heart of Mary and celebrated the liturgies of Holy Thursday, Good Friday and the Easter Vigil for local Catholics who remained in their cars.</p>

<p>The guidelines also lay out strict instructions for the distribution of Communion, with priests told to wear a face mask, sanitize their hands, and wear gloves for the distribution.</p>

<p>Baldacchino also encouraged priests to continue hearing confessions and ensure that the anointing of the sick was still available where necessary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Priests may and should continue to offer&rdquo; the sacraments, he said. &ldquo;The faithful are not to be deprived of this sacrament, especially when in danger of death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In recent weeks, Baldacchino himself has frequently heard confessions behind a screen outside the cathedral in Las Cruces.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Poland&#39;s parliament will consider a citizen-initiated bill to ban abortion in cases where the unborn child has a severe abnormality, though it is unclear whether the bill has enough support to become law.</p>

<p>About 830,000 citizens signed the petition for the citizen&#39;s bill which is now set for an April 16 vote in the lower house of Poland&#39;s parliament. The bill would bar abortion in cases where the unborn child has an abnormality. It is the most common reason for abortion in Poland, and sometimes used in cases where the child is not expected to survive.</p>

<p>The Catholic bishops made a general statement on abortion restrictions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Polish Bishops&#39; Conference supports all initiatives aimed at protecting human life from conception to natural death,&rdquo; Fr. Pawel Rytel-Andrianik, spokesman for the Polish bishops&rsquo; conference, said on Twitter April 15.</p>

<p>Polish law allows abortion only in cases of rape, incest, threat to the mother&#39;s life, or fetal abnormality. About 700-1,800 legal abortions take place in Poland each year.</p>

<p>President Andrzej Duda, who is allied with the Law and Justice party, has said that he backs further restrictions on abortion and would sign such restrictions into law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe that killing disabled children is simply murder,&rdquo; he told the Catholic news outlet Niedziela, according to Reuters.</p>

<p>While the Law and Justice party-led conservative coalition controls parliament and tends to support pro-life causes, the ruling party appears reluctant to back the bill.</p>

<p>Law and Justice spokesman Radoslaw Fogiel said lawmakers are divided on the citizen abortion bill and party discipline is not implemented on such matters.</p>

<p>Polls suggest Duda is on track to win the presidential elections held May 10, but there are uncertainties because of the situation under the new coronavirus. Efforts to limit the spread of the coronavirus include holding the election by mail ballot, but minority parties object that the fact the election will take place at all gives unfair advantages to the incumbent party.</p>

<p>A previous citizen&#39;s bill to ban all abortions in Poland failed to pass parliament in 2015, as did later parliamentary proposals. Foes of a 2016 bill to further restrict abortions rallied about 100,000 protesters across the country.</p>

<p>Abortion proponents&#39; efforts to make abortion law more permissive have also failed. Many women who seek abortions go abroad to countries with more permissive abortion law.</p>

<p>Another citizen&#39;s bill up for consideration would ban sex education and make it a criminal offense to promote or approve sexual intercourse or other sexual activity by a minor.</p>

<p>Backers say it will combat sexual abuse of minors and discourage promiscuity.</p>

<p>Authors of the &ldquo;Stop Pedophilia&rdquo; bill said sex educators often &ldquo;groom and familiarize children with homosexuality,&rdquo; Reuters reports. &ldquo;The organizations and activists most involved in the promotion of sexual &lsquo;education&rsquo; in our country are the LGBT lobby,&rdquo; they charged in a document to parliament accompanying the proposed law. Sex education lessons, they charged, are used &ldquo;by the LGBT lobby to achieve radical political goals,&rdquo; including adoption by same-sex couples.</p>

<p>Schools in Poland do not often offer sex education, but teach students to prepare for family life. Last year the Law and Justice party condemned a local push for sex education in Warsaw, where opposing political parties hold control.</p>

<p>More than 200,000 people participated in Marches for Life and Family in 130 cities across Poland in June 2019 in protest of sex education in schools.</p>

<p>The Catholic Church in Poland supported the marches, and the Polish bishops&rsquo; conference thanked the faithful for participating in the marches at their June plenary meeting. According to the bishops&#39; press office, the bishops warned against &ldquo;the promotion of ideologies inimical to natural law and Christian values and against the attempts at introducing such ideologies to schools under the guise of sexual education.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Critics of the sex education ban objected to linking sex educators with pedophiles and said it would encourage persecution of homosexuals.</p>

<p>While Polish critics of the citizens&#39; bills claimed backers were pushing them forward under cover of the coronavirus pandemic, Elzbieta Witek said they are citizen&#39;s initiatives which must be considered under the law, the Associated Press reports.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that they are controversial,&rdquo; Witek said. &ldquo;But in a democratic state &mdash; and Poland is such a state &mdash; citizens&rsquo; projects must be subjected to proceedings in the Polish parliament, because that&rsquo;s the law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Draginja Nadazdin, the director of Amnesty International in Poland, called both citizen bills &quot;draconian.&quot;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Attempting to pass these recklessly retrogressive laws at any time would be shameful, but to rush them through under the cover of the COVID-19 crisis is unconscionable,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Amnesty International, a human rights organization, enjoyed significant Catholic support until it adopted a pro-abortion rights policy in 2007, prompting many Catholics and other pro-life advocates to resign. Now it is part of abortion advocacy worldwide, backed by funders like billionaire financier George Soros&rsquo; Open Society Foundations, which also seeks change on abortion in Poland and other strongly Catholic countries.</p>

<p>In August 2016, CNA broke the news that documents allegedly hacked from the Open Society Foundations and posted to the site DCLeaks.com included a strategy proposal targeting the Republic of Ireland&rsquo;s pro-life constitutional protections for the unborn child by backing several pro-abortion rights groups, including Amnesty Ireland.</p>

<p>The foundations&rsquo; strategy suggested that a pro-abortion rights victory in Ireland &ldquo;could impact other strongly Catholic countries in Europe, such as Poland, and provide much needed proof that change is possible, even in highly conservative places.&rdquo;</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Commission on Religious Freedom has called on the Pakistani government to ensure aid for the COVID-19 pandemic is being justly distributed to religious minorities, after receiving reports that aid organizations were barring Christians and Hindus from receiving food assistance.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;These actions are simply reprehensible,&rdquo; USCIRF Commissioner Anurima Bhargava said in an April 13 statement. &ldquo;As COVID-19 continues to spread, vulnerable communities within Pakistan are fighting hunger and to keep their families safe and healthy. Food aid must not be denied because of one&rsquo;s faith. We urge the Pakistani government to ensure that food aid from distributing organizations is shared equally with Hindus, Christians, and other religions minorities,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>According to the commission, recent reports have shown that in Karachi a non-government aid organization, the Saylani Welfare International Trust, has been denying food assistance to Christians and Hindus, telling them that the aid was reserved for Muslims. Pakistan&rsquo;s state religion is Islam, and around 97 percent of the population is Muslim.</p>

<p>The authorities of Pakistan have consistently failed to implement safeguards on behalf of religious minorities, despite numerous policies in favor of economic and physical protections for members of non-Muslim religions.</p>

<p>For example, the country has promised to provide quotas for employment to ensure that religious minorities are granted equal access to jobs, but so far it has not done so.</p>

<p>Additionally, strict blasphemy laws in the country are reportedly used to settle scores or to persecute religious minorities. While non-Muslims constitute only 3 percent of the Pakistani population, 14 percent of blasphemy cases have been levied against them.</p>

<p>In a recent highly publicized case, Asia Bibi, a Christian mother of five, spent eight years on death row on blasphemy charges after being accused of making disparaging remarks about Muhammad after an argument stemming from a cup of water. Amid strong international pressure, the Pakistan Supreme Court acquitted her in late 2018.</p>

<p>A 2019 report from USCIRF found that Christians and Hindus &ldquo;face continued threats to their security and are subject to various forms of harassment and social exclusion,&rdquo; the USCIRF statement said.</p>

<p>The country was also designated by the US Department of State as a &ldquo;Country of Particular Concern&rdquo; in December 2018 for its poor religious freedom record.</p>

<p>USCIRF Commissioner Johnnie Moore noted in the April 13 statement that in a recent address to the international community, Prime Minister Imran Khan said that governments in developing countries must work to save people from starvation during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Pakistan&rsquo;s health ministry has reported nearly 6,000 cases of coronavirus in the country of 212 million people as of April 15.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a monumental task laying before many countries. Prime Minister Khan&rsquo;s government has the opportunity to lead the way but they must not leave religious minorities behind,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Otherwise, they may add on top of it all one more crisis, created by religious discrimination and inter-communal strife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A March 2020 report from USCIRF noted other countries who have had religious freedom problems in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, including in China, where the virus originated.</p>

<p>According to USCIRF, reports indicated that Chinese authorities forced Uighurs, a Muslim minority that has been forced into concentration camps since 2017, to work in factories to make up for the lack of workers during the country&rsquo;s coronavirus quarantine. Reports also indicated that some Uighur residents in the city of Ghulja had &ldquo;limited access to food and local officials have demanded payments in order to bring supplies,&rdquo; USCIRF noted.<br />
<br />
In South Korea, the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a fringe Christian group that reported already facing &ldquo;hostility&rdquo; from mainline Protestants before the pandemic, faced additional pressures and harassment from the government and citizens after a 61-year-old female member of the church - known as Patient 31 - attended a church service with a fever before being diagnosed with coronavirus, and thus spreading the infection to thousands of others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Shincheonji church has faced considerable criticism and even harassment from the South Korean government and society. Although some government measures appeared to be driven by legitimate public health concerns, others appeared to exaggerate the church&rsquo;s role in the outbreak,&rdquo; USCIRF reported, adding that members of the church have faced &ldquo;discrimination at work and spousal abuse because of their affiliation with the church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other countries in which coronavirus is reportedly impacting religious freedoms include Iran, Saudi Arabia, Georgia, Italy and the Vatican (for government-mandated cancellation of religious services), the United Arab Emirates, Georgia, and Tajikistan.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>As aid agencies struggle to contain the coronavirus pandemic in parts of the developing world, Catholic Relief Services said it is relying on past experience in handling mass outbreaks of disease as it manages its own response to COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The aid agency, which is present in more than 90 countries and serves more than 130 million people each year, said Wednesday that it is ramping up aid efforts in countries across the world and taking a flexible approach to fighting the coronavirus. CRS is part of Caritas International, the global network of Catholic humanitarian organizations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nikki Gamer, a spokesperson for Catholic Relief Services (CRS), told CNA on Wednesday that the organization is &ldquo;working tirelessly to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to respond to its impact on some of the most vulnerable communities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are adapting existing programs to ensure things like social distancing and proper handwashing, for example, and are initiating new activities focused on creating awareness, prevention and quality care for those affected,&rdquo; she told CNA.</p>

<p>Previously, CRS has worked to contain the spread of other infectious diseases and viruses, including tuberculosis, cholera, HIV, and polio. The organization worked extensively from 2014-2016 in various western African nations during the ebola outbreak, something that CRS President and CEO Sean Callahan said has influenced how they are handling COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our COVID-19 response will draw upon our experience in acute health emergencies,&rdquo; such as ebola and HIV, said Callahan in a release issued Wednesday by CRS. &ldquo;Our work will be informed by the local context and focus on some of the most vulnerable communities.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Callahan called CRS particularly &ldquo;well-positioned&rdquo; to assist throughout the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our staff and partners have been a constant presence in some of the most vulnerable communities for more than 75 years and we are leveraging those relationships in times of an outbreak,&rdquo; said Callahan. This extensive existing network has meant that CRS was able to &ldquo;scale up&rdquo; its efforts in key locations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Presently, CRS is focusing much of their efforts to combat the spread of coronavirus in parts of Africa, as well as Gaza and Cambodia. In Cambodia, which is not currently experiencing outbreaks at the same levels as other countries, CRS said it is working proactively with the country&rsquo;s Ministry of Health and conducting health training at the provincial level to prevent mass spread of the disease from occuring.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CRS has also sent nurses from its internship program to Gaza to help provide &ldquo;surge staffing&rdquo; in health facilities there.</p>

<p>In Kenya, CRS is moving to assist the health system in the capital of Nairobi through trainings on prevention and control of COVID-19, and has been training Kenyan healthcare workers located in areas where the disease may become prevalent. In Ethiopia, CRS has been providing workers at Catholic health facilities with personal protective equipment and isolation tents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As lockdown measures in many countries create widespread economic uncertainty and hardship for many families and businesses, Gamer told CNA that the&nbsp;organization faced similar challanges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are immensely thankful to know that the Catholic community always unites in crisis to come together to help those in most need,&rdquo; said Gamer. &ldquo;There is no difference now, even with the added layers of lockdowns and social distancing closing churches in our communities.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A person can donate through the CRS website, said Gamer, adding, &ldquo;we thank all of our supporters for their collective efforts in helping us slow the spread of coronavirus for the most vulnerable people around the world.&rdquo;</p>]]></description>

			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/california-churches-sue-governor-to-allow-public-worship-services-amid-coronavirus-25038</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Three Southern California ecclesial communities have filed a lawsuit against Governor Gavin Newsom, alleging that social distancing orders he imposed amid COVID-19 violate their first amendment right to freedom of religion.</p>

<p>Newsom imposed a stay-at-home order for the state March 19, mandating that nonessential businesses close their doors and restricting gatherings. Newsom&rsquo;s order does not list houses of worship as &ldquo;essential.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Center for American Liberty, a California-based nonprofit, filed the suit April 13 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. State Attorney General Xavier Becerra, as well as officials of San Bernardino and Riverside counties who imposed additional stay-at-home orders, are also named in the suit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If a Californian is able to go to Costco or the local marijuana shop or liquor store and buy goods in a responsible, socially distanced manner, then he or she must be allowed to practice their faith using the same precautions,&rdquo; Harmeet Dhillon, chief executive of the Center for American Liberty, said in an April 13 statement.</p>

<p>The churches involved in the suit include Church Unlimited, a church located in Riverside county, whose pastor received a $1,000 fine for holding a Palm Sunday service.</p>

<p>The head pastor of Shield of Faith Family Church in San Bernardino county and the senior pastor of Word of Life Ministries International in Riverside county also are involved in the suit.</p>

<p>The churches argue that the state and local orders are overly broad, and that they can practice safe social distancing in the same manner as grocery stores and other businesses considered essential, the Associated Press reports.</p>

<p>San Bernardino county&rsquo;s April 7 stay-at-home order mandated that faith-based services &ldquo;must be electronic only through streaming or online technology,&rdquo; adding that people may not leave their homes for &ldquo;driving parades or drive-up services or to pick up non-essential items such as pre-packaged Easter eggs or bags filled with candy and toys at a drive-thru location.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Riverside county&rsquo;s order, imposed April 10, allowed for drive-up church services the weekend of Easter, but mandated that such activities would be prohibited after Easter Sunday.</p>

<p>On Friday, a federal judge refused to allow a small church in Campo, Abiding Place Ministries, to gather for Easter Sunday services, the AP reports.</p>

<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic has spread in the U.S., state and local governments have enacted various restrictions on public activities and gatherings.</p>

<p>Some officials have curtailed public religious services entirely and threatened serious consequences for churches which do not comply.</p>

<p>New York City mayor Bill DeBlasio threatened to close down churches and synagogues permanently if they still held public services. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear (D) said state police would record the license plate numbers of attendees of large religious services over Easter, with local health officials requiring them to self-quarantine for 14 days afterward. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam (D) criminalized certain public gatherings of 10 or more people, which included religious gatherings.</p>

<p>In Kansas, Governor Laura Kelly (R) initially exempted religious services from the state&rsquo;s limitation of public gatherings to no more than 10 people, but then included religious services in the regulations.</p>

<p>Local authorities on April 8 fined attendees at a drive-in service at a Baptist church in Greenville, Mississippi, prompting the Department of Justice to file a statement of interest on Tuesday in support of the church.</p>

<p>Attorney General William Barr issued a statement April 14 &ldquo;on religious practice and social distancing&rdquo; where he clarified that governments cannot put special burdens on religious practice that they do not also impose upon other activities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For example, if a government allows movie theaters, restaurants, concert halls, and other comparable places of assembly to remain open and unrestricted, it may not order houses of worship to close, limit their congregation size, or otherwise impede religious gatherings,&rdquo; Barr said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Religious institutions must not be singled out for special burdens.&rdquo;</p>]]></description>

			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/federal-court-says-chemical-abortions-can-continue-despite-texas-order-73119</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Chemical abortions in Texas will continue during the coronavirus pandemic after the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to overturn a lower court&rsquo;s order on Tuesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>On April 9, the Western District Court of Texas placed a temporary restraining order on parts of the state&rsquo;s ban on elective abortions during the new coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The court&rsquo;s order allowed chemical abortions in the state to continue, as well as some surgical abortions.</p>

<p>Reviewing the court&rsquo;s order on chemical abortions, a three-judge panel for the Fifth Circuit on Tuesday declined to overturn it, saying it had &ldquo;doubts&rdquo; about the state&rsquo;s argument.</p>

<p>Gov. Greg Abbott (R) had issued an executive order in March halting non-essential medical and dental procedures during the pandemic to conserve medical resources for treating COVID-19.</p>

<p>Attorney General Ken Paxton applied the order&rsquo;s prohibitions to elective surgical and chemical abortions, except in cases where the mother&rsquo;s life or health was deemed to be in jeopardy.</p>

<p>In a March 31 interview with <em>EWTN Pro-Life Weekly, </em>Paxton explained that the ban also applied to other non-essential procedures such as non-emergency dental and orthopedic procedures. The order was &ldquo;something that could be used to save peoples&rsquo; lives,&rdquo; Paxton said.</p>

<p>Abortion providers sued and the district court halted the abortion provisions of the order from going into effect, allowing abortions in the state to continue.</p>

<p>After reviewing the district court decision, however, the Fifth Circuit sided with Texas and allowed the state&rsquo;s order to continue.</p>

<p>Then, on April 9, the district court applied a narrower restraining order on Abbot&rsquo;s act, allowing chemical abortions in the state to continue as well as certain surgical abortions&mdash;in cases where women would be past 18 weeks of pregnancy and unable to access ambulatory surgical centers by April 22, or when mothers would be past 22 weeks of pregnancy by April 22.</p>

<p>The Fifth Circuit ruled on Tuesday that both the state and abortion providers failed to &ldquo;settle&rdquo; the question of whether or not the executive order &ldquo;applies to medication abortions,&rdquo; and thus &ldquo;given the ambiguity in the record,&rdquo; the judges concluded that the state failed to make its case for the district court&rsquo;s order to be overturned.</p>

<p>Similar state actions in Ohio, Alabama, and Oklahoma have been halted in whole or in part from going into effect by courts.</p>

<p>A federal judge on Easter Sunday ruled that the goals of Alabama&rsquo;s order, issued to conserve medical resources during the pandemic, &ldquo;do not outweigh the lasting harm imposed by the denial of an individual&rsquo;s right to terminate her pregnancy, by an undue burden or increase in risk on patients imposed by a delayed procedure, or by the cloud of unwarranted prosecution against providers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Susan B. Anthony List president Marjorie Dannenfelser warned about an increase in chemical abortions as many parts of the U.S. are under shelter-in-place orders. She called chemical abortions the &ldquo;next frontier&rdquo; of the abortion lobby, in an <a href="https://townhall.com/columnists/marjoriedannenfelser/2020/04/14/chemical-self-abortions-the-other-looming-deadly-crisis-n2566658">op-ed</a> for <em>Townhall</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next frontier is the expansion, via telemedicine and the mail, of so-called &lsquo;self-managed&rsquo; abortion (their term) using dangerous drugs,&rdquo; Dannenfelser wrote, noting that chemical abortions already make up anywhere from 30 to 50% of abortions in the U.S.</p>]]></description>

			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/vatican-creates-commission-to-address-coronavirus-aftermath-30335</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Vatican is creating a commission to provide local aid and tackle issues related to the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, according to a statement released Wednesday.</p>

<p>The group, created at the request of Pope Francis, will work in collaboration with the Roman Curia and specifically the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development.</p>

<p>The commission has been formed &ldquo;to express the concern and love of the Church for the whole human family in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, above all through the analysis and reflection on the socio-economic and cultural challenges of the future and the proposal of guidelines to face them,&rdquo; according to the April 15 announcement.</p>

<p>The commission will be headed by the leadership of the Integral Development dicastery: prefect Cardinal Peter Turkson, secretary Archbishop Bruno-Marie Duff&eacute;, and new deputy secretary Fr. Augusto Zampini. The directorate will report directly to Pope Francis.</p>

<p>Speaking to Vatican Media, Turkson said that Pope Francis has expressed his concern at the crisis caused by COVID-19 &ldquo;and for the dramatic scenarios on the horizon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pope Francis &ldquo;told us not to waste time, to get down to work immediately,&rdquo; the cardinal said in the April 15 interview. &ldquo;We must act now. And we must immediately think about what will happen next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is important to begin to reason immediately about what lies around the corner so as not to be unprepared,&rdquo; Turkson argued, noting that &ldquo;the health crisis has already triggered an economic one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The risk is that a social crisis will be provoked if this economic crisis is not dealt with immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The commission is planning to have five working groups focused on different tasks related to the current crisis and to the aftermath of COVID-19.</p>

<p>One of these groups will focus on researching the post-coronavirus world in the areas of environment, economy, work, health, politics, communication, and security.</p>

<p>Another working group will be centered on giving assistance to the local Churches, in cooperation with pontifical aid organization Caritas Internationalis.</p>

<p>Turkson said &ldquo;our mission is not to replace the action of the local Churches, but to help them and be helped by them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Secretariat of State&rsquo;s section for relations with states will head up a working group overseeing possible initiatives regarding international relations.</p>

<p>There will also be a working group to handle the commission&rsquo;s funding and another to oversee the commission&rsquo;s communications.</p>

<p>Turkson said the group dedicated to funding &ldquo;will be responsible for finding the necessary funds in a transparent manner, by promoting a virtuous movement of wealth.&rdquordquo;</p>

<p>The cardinal also said that the commission would involve other institutions in its work, such as Georgetown University, the World Resources Institute, and Potsdam University.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a need for courage, for prophecy,&rdquo; Turkson said. &ldquo;The pope made this clear in his Urbi et Orbi message. This is not the time for indifference, selfishness or divisions, because the whole world is suffering and must find itself united in confronting the pandemic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turkson advised states to relax international sanctions and called for the debt burdens of the poorest countries to be reduced or forgiven.</p>

<p>He also urged a global ceasefire and an end to the manufacture and trafficking of weapons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is time to enable all states to meet the greatest needs of the moment,&rdquo; he said.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Justice Department (DOJ) is supporting a Mississippi church after local authorities fined attendees at a drive-in service during the coronavirus pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The DOJ filed a statement of interest on Tuesday in support of Temple Baptist Church in Greenville, Mississippi, that held drive-in services where attendees listened to the service on their car radios. The church took the special precautions in response to the new coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, where the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has recommended gatherings of fewer than 10 people, spaced at least six feet apart, to halt the spread of the virus.</p>

<p>In its brief, the DOJ argued that the church tailored its services to comply with public health guidelines, and that the city government acted unfairly in enforcing its restrictions on churches but not on other entities such as restaurants serving drive-in patrons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In addition to appearing non-neutral, the church&rsquo;s allegations also tend to show that the city&rsquo;s emergency actions are not applied in a generally applicable manner,&rdquo; DOJ stated.</p>

<p>Mississippi&rsquo;s governor Tate Reeves (R) issued a shelter-in-place order requiring citizens to stay at home except for certain reasons, and listed churches as &ldquo;essential&rdquo; institutions that could remain open while complying with certain guidelines.</p>

<p>The city of Greenville, however, curtailed drive-in religious services until the governor&rsquo;s order was lifted. On April 8, law enforcement handed out citations to attendees at a Temple Baptist Church drive-in service, with fines of $500.</p>

<p>According to the church&rsquo;s complaint, attendees were inside their cars with their windows rolled up. Member Lee Gordon told the <em>Delta Democrat Times</em> that a nearby SONIC fast-food restaurant was open for drive-in patrons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The church said that many members do not have the ability to stream services online, and thus a drive-in service would accommodate far more congregants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to the DOJ&rsquo;s brief in the case, Attorney General William Barr issued a statement on Tuesday &ldquo;on religious practice and social distancing&rdquo; where he clarified that governments cannot put special burdens on religious practice that they do not also impose upon other activities.</p>

<p>As states and local governments have the authority to enact certain restrictions tailored to a public emergency, &ldquo;the constitution does allow some temporary restriction on our liberties that would not be tolerated in normal circumstances,&rdquo; Barr said.</p>

<p>However, he added, these regulations cannot impede religious practice while allowing exemptions for other public activities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For example, if a government allows movie theaters, restaurants, concert halls, and other comparable places of assembly to remain open and unrestricted, it may not order houses of worship to close, limit their congregation size, or otherwise impede religious gatherings,&rdquo; Barr said. &ldquo;Religious institutions must not be singled out for special burdens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In applying the test of the federal and state Religious Freedom Restoration Act&mdash;where a government must prove that its substantial burden on religious exercise furthers a compelling public interest and is the least-restrictive means of doing so&mdash;the DOJ said the city&rsquo;s prohibition on drive-in religious gatherings likely fails the test, as it is being less restrictive of other establishments such as drive-in restaurants.</p>

<p>As the church requires attendees to space their cars out beyond federally-recommended social distancing guidelines, and to remain in their cars with their windows up, &ldquo;it is unclear why prohibiting these services is the least restrictive means of protecting public health, especially if, as alleged in the complaint, the city allows other conduct that would appear to pose an equal&mdash;if not greater&mdash;risks,&rdquo; DOJ stated.</p>

<p>As the new coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has spread in the U.S., state and local governments have enacted various restrictions on public activities and gatherings.</p>

<p>Some officials have curtailed public religious services entirely and threatened serious consequences for churches which do not comply.</p>

<p>New York City mayor Bill DeBlasio threatened to close down churches and synagogues permanently if they still held public services. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear (D) said state police would record the license plate numbers of attendees of large religious services over Easter, with local health officials requiring them to self-quarantine for 14 days afterward. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam (D) criminalized certain public gatherings of 10 or more people, which included religious gatherings.</p>

<p>In Kansas, Governor Laura Kelly (R) initially exempted religious services from the state&rsquo;s limitation of public gatherings to no more than 10 people, but then included religious services in the regulations.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Sister Isabel Garc&iacute;a is a Josephine of the Most Holy Trinity religious sister who, until recently, was teaching primary school and high school students in Plasencia, in west central Spain.</p>

<p>But on March 16, Spain shut down schools &ndash; including Most Holy Trinity school, where she worked &ndash; as the COVID-19 outbreak started taking a heavy toll on the country.</p>

<p>Two weeks later, Garc&iacute;a read in the newspaper that some residents and workers at the local Virgen del Puerto nursing home had tested positive for the coronavirus and that management was having a hard time finding new workers.</p>

<p>So, she told hoy.es, she decided to start helping out at the facility, which houses more than 80 elderly people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I felt that with what was going on, I couldn&rsquo;t just stand idly by. I had to help, and I had to do it for those people who are the weakest today, the elderly,&rdquo; she explained.</p>

<p>Garc&iacute;a contacted management at the residence and offered to work. She began working there the next day, and has been there ever since, she told hoy.es.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I decided to stay there because even though our school is near the residence, we have older sisters, and I don&rsquo;t want to put anyone at risk. We thought this was the best thing to do to avoid the risk of infecting others as much as possible,&rdquo; she stressed.</p>

<p>Garc&iacute;a does whatever is needed each day: &ldquo;I help in the kitchen, serving meals, other times I&rsquo;m in the laundry room&hellip;I go from one job to another because there&rsquo;s a lot of things that have to be done, and in my spare time I go around to the [residents&rsquo;] rooms and talk with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That contact with the elderly is what she likes the most about her service at the home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re alone and sad, isolated in their rooms,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s for their own well-being, but they really miss their family members, their friends there at the residence. They can talk with their loved ones on the phone, but it&rsquo;s not enough. They need a lot of love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Garc&iacute;a said she&rsquo;s afraid that if the situation lasts for a substantial amount of time, this sadness the elderly are experiencing &ldquo;could turn into depression in some cases.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The religious sister said she hopes to keep working at the residence &ldquo;if possible, until this is over, combining it with my work as a teacher, which I&rsquo;m doing by sending homework online to the students and then correcting it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She also had high praise for her coworkers at the nursing home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wonderful care [the residents] are getting from all the workers at this residence, for whom it&rsquo;s not a sacrifice to come here every day, quite the opposite, they&rsquo;re people who care for the elderly with enthusiasm, kindness and love.&rdquo;</p>

			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/new-director-named-for-vatican-financial-watchdog-authority-63580</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Vatican has named a new director for its internal financial watchdog.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a statement April 15, the Holy See press office said that the Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin had appointed Giuseppe Schlitzer as director of the Financial Intelligence Authority (AIF). He succeeds Tommaso Di Ruzza, who completed his five-year term of office January 20, according to the Vatican.</p>

<p>Cardinal Parolin also named a new vice-director, Federico Antellini Russo.</p>

<p>The two men will run the watchdog, which combats money laundering, along with AIF President Carmelo Barbagallo, who was appointed after the departure of Ren&eacute; Br&uuml;lhart in Nov. 2019. A Vatican statement at the time said that Br&uuml;lhart was leaving at the end of his five-year term, but the Swiss lawyer told Reuters that he had resigned from the post.</p>

<p>Schlitzer has held positions at Banca d&rsquo;Italia, Italy&rsquo;s central bank, the International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C., and the General Confederation of Italian Industry. He has served as managing director of AITEC, an association of cement producers, and vice-president of the Jacques Maritain International Institute.</p>

<p>Antellini Russo has worked at the AIF since 2015. He served as an economist in the research and development section of the joint-stock company Consip from 2008 to 2013. He then moved to the research department of the Italian investment bank Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, before joining the AIF. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pope Benedict XVI founded the AIF in 2010 to oversee Vatican financial transactions. It is charged with ensuring that internal banking policies comply with international financial standards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2013 the AIF became a full member of the Egmont Group, a global network of financial intelligence units. But the Egmont Group suspended the AIF on Nov. 13, 2019, after Vatican gendarmes raided the offices of the Secretariat of State and the AIF. It reinstated the AIF on Jan. 22 this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the raid on the AIF on Oct. 1, 2019, a total of five employees and officials were suspended and blocked from entering the Vatican, including AIF director Tommaso Di Ruzza.</p>

<p>On Oct. 23, the AIF&rsquo;s board of directors issued a statement expressing &ldquo;full faith and trust in the professional competence and honorability&rdquo; of Di Ruzza, but no announcement was ever made by Vatican authorities regarding the results of any investigation into Di Ruzza or his return to work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During an in-flight press conference after his trip to Japan on Nov. 26, Pope Francis said that Di Ruzza had been suspended &ldquo;because there were suspicions of poor administration&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope he is innocent,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I would like it to be so because it&rsquo;s a good thing that a person be innocent and not guilty, I hope so.&quot;</p>

<p>Following the raids, the Egmont Group suspension and the exit of Ren&eacute; Br&uuml;lhart, two high-profile figures, Marc Odendall and Juan Zarate, resigned from the AIF&rsquo;s board of directors. Odendall said at the time that the AIF had been effectively rendered &ldquo;an empty shell&rdquo; and that there was &ldquo;no point&rdquo; in remaining involved in its work. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moneyval, the Council of Europe&rsquo;s anti-money laundering watchdog, is expected to carry out an inspection of the Vatican this spring.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ACI Stampa, CNA&#39;s Italian-language partner agency, <a href="https://www.acistampa.com/story/finanze-vaticane-giuseppe-schlitzer-direttore-dellautorita-di-informazione-finanziaria-13913">quoted</a> outgoing director Di Ruzza as saying: &quot;I thank the Holy Father for the opportunity he has granted me to serve the Holy See. I am confident that in these years AIF has done its best to build a solid and credible anti-money laundering system at the international level.&rdquo;</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Pope Francis prayed for the elderly who are afraid of dying alone at his morning Mass on Wednesday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us pray today for the elderly, especially for those who are isolated or in nursing homes. They are afraid, afraid of dying alone,&rdquo; Pope Francis said before Mass on April 15.</p>

<p>The pope said that the elderly are &ldquo;our roots, our story, our history,&rdquo; and asked the Lord to be close to them as the world faces the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>As COVID-19 has led to the deaths of more than 125,000 people worldwide, dioceses have sought creative solutions to bring the sacraments to the elderly and the dying. In Chicago, <a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/team-of-young-chicago-priests-answer-the-call-to-anoint-covid-19-patients-77886">a team of 24 priest volunteers</a> -- all under age 60 -- administer sacramental anointing of the sick to Catholics with the coronavirus.</p>

<p>In his homily, Pope Francis said that God is faithful to his promises. &ldquo;Our faithfulness is nothing but a response to God&#39;s faithfulness,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our God is a God who works overtime,&rdquo; the pope said. &ldquo;Like that shepherd who, when he returns home, realizes that he is missing a sheep and goes, goes back to look for the sheep that has been lost there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God&#39;s faithfulness always precedes us, and our faithfulness is always the answer to that fidelity that precedes us,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Speaking from the chapel of his Vatican residence, Casa Santa Marta, the pope said that God is patient with his people, as he was with the two disciples walking on the road to Emmaus in the Gospel of John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God&#39;s faithfulness is a patient faithfulness: he has patience with his people, listens to them, guides them,&rdquo; the pope said.</p>

<p>At the end of the Mass, Pope Francis dedicated a moment of prayer to Mary as the &ldquo;Regina Coeli&rdquo; Marian antiphon for the Easter season was sung in Latin:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Queen of heaven, rejoice, alleluia.<br />
For he whom you did merit to bear, alleluia,<br />
Has risen, as he said, alleluia.<br />
Pray for us to God, alleluia.<br />
Rejoice and be glad, O Virgin Mary, alleluia.<br />
For the Lord has truly risen, alleluia.&rdquo;</p>]]></description>
